\chapter{Vicinity information in the model}
\label{chapter:vicinity}

In the basic model of minority games all agents act independently without the ability to communicate with each other.
Only means of passing information between them is by using the history of the model that encapsulates all the decisions of agents in a string of bits.
This simple model allows us to study certain characteristics of competitive systems with limited resources, however it is not a realistic assumption to think of agents as isolated elements that don't communicate with their neighbours.
